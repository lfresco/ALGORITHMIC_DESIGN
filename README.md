# ALGORITHMIC DESIGN

This repository contains the solutions for the exercises assigned during the lessons of the Algorithmic Design course of the Master in Data Science and Scientific Computing @ Universit√† degli Studi di Trieste.

## STRASSEN 
The folder contains an improved version of the Strassen algroithm for Matrix Multiplication.

## CHAIN
The folder contains the implementation of the MAtrixMultiplicationChain algorithm used to find the best parentetisation 
for a chain of matrix multiplications

## SORTING 
The folder contains the implementation of the following sorting algorithms 
- InsertionSort
- QuickSort
- HeapSort
- CountingSort
- RadixSort
and finally the Select algorithm.

## HEAP 
The folder contains the implementation of a array-based binary heap. 

## DIJKSTRA
This folder contains the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for the SSP problem, with two different queue implementations (array and heap based).
