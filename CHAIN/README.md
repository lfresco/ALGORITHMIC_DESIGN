# CHAIN OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION

The code in this folder implements an algorithm used to find the less expensive parentetisazion of a chain of multiplications of matrices. It is tested on a randomly generate set of matrices and compared against the "naive" idea of simply splitting the problem starting from the middle of the chain. 

## Running the test
